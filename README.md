# DeckOfCards class and a simple game in the browser...



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run all the usual CRA scripts, but of note:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner.  I've added some tests for DeckOfCards


## Design decisions

* Create React App; just because it's an standard and provides a baseline
